Build a containerized CRUD app using Node JS / MySQL.

- The solution should be built with a docker compose manifest 
- The manifest should include REST API container and MySQL Database container 
- API should contain end points to Create, Read, Delete and List an Entity. For example Device. Attributes - Id, Type, Version, description. Etc 
- demonstrate use of the API using a REST test like Postman or Insomnia
- Bonus points for a ReactJS/Redux UI
- The app should be self contained to be tested locally. You can either share a zip file or create a public GitHub repository.
